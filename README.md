<h1>Number Guessing Game</h1>

<p>Create a C++ object-oriented Number Guessing Game with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two classes, Player1 and Player2</li>
<li>Tossing feature</li>
<li>Various functions such as thinknumber(), toss(), guessnumber(), and more</li>
<li>Keep track of the number of attempts made by the player to guess the number</li>
</ul>

<p>A. Initially, design the game using <strong>friend functions</strong> and two player classes. The friend functions could include thinknumber(), toss(), guessnumber(), and others.</p>

<p>B. Then, modify the game design by introducing a <strong>friend class</strong> named GameManager. This class will handle the tossing and guessing functions for the players, as well as maintain a record of the attempts made.</p>
